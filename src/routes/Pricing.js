      <h2>$1 per 1 turn up</h2>
      <p>Itâ€™s very simple!</p>

      <p>
        For example, If you have capacity of 80 people, 70 people RSVP and 50
        people turn up on time, the fee will be $50.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plus VAT depending on the business location your organisation
        operations. We are incorporated in UK and business entities in some
        country may have tax exemption.
      </p>

      <h2>Not conviced yet?</h2>
      <p>
        We will send an invoice after the end of each event so that you only pay
        when you are happy with our service. You can either do bank transfer or
        send us in DAI. In future we will incorporate the payment mechanism into
        our smart contract.
      </p>

      <h2>Too expensive?</h2>
      <p>
        For recurring events, we will offer quarterly payment of $150
        ($50/month) for normal evens but $45 ($15/month) for events organised by
        non profits, individuals, and students. If you decide to choose the
        quarterly payment model, we ask you to pay upfront. In future we will
        incorporate the recurring payment mechanism into our smart contract.
